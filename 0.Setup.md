### R / RStudio

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

**Windows**
Install R by downloading and running the [correct installer file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

**Linux**
You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

### Install the required packages

```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "vegan", "ggplot2"));
```


That's it, all done! You have now all the tools in place!
